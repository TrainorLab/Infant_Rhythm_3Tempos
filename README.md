In the main branch, find the Matlab code used to preprocess the EEG data (Individual EEG data available upon request) for the "Investigating generalizability of top-down neural representation of metre in infancy" manuscript by Erica Flaten and Laurel Trainor. The main scripts for preprocessing are 'Erica01_preprocessing_infants.m', followed by 'Erica02a_Infant_ERP.m' and 'mmr_data_export_maxpeak.m' for the MMR analysis, or 'Erica02b_Infant_freq.m' for ITPC and SSEP analyses.

In another folder ('lme_analysis'), find the code and data for running the main lme analyses of the paper.
